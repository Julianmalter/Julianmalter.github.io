    <br>
    <p1>Global Warming causes a plethora of problems for our Earth.</p1>
    <p2>Some of them include:</p2>
    <br>
    <p3>1. Hotter temperatures</p3>
    <br>
    <p4>2. More severe storms</p4>
    <br>
    <p5>3. Increased drought</p5>
    <br>
    <p6>4. A warming, rising ocean</p6>
    <br>
    <p7>5. A loss of species</p7>
    <br>
    <p8>6. Not enough food</p8>
    <br>
    <p9>7. More health risks</p9>
    <br>
    <p10>8. Poverty and displacement</p10>
    <br>
    <p11>Storms, heat waves, floods, and droughts are just a few of the calamities that are getting worse as a result of rising temperatures. Furthermore, it produces an atmosphere that can hold onto, release, and gather more water, altering weather patterns such that moist areas get wetter and dry ones get dryer.</p11>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p12>More severe storms may wreak havoc by causing a ton of erosion, a ton of house or institution destruction, and a ton of deaths.</p12>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p13>Due to global warming, water supply is shifting and is becoming increasingly scarce in many areas. Global warming exacerbates water shortages in regions that already have a scarcity. It also makes ecosystems more sensitive and raises the risk of ecological and agricultural droughts, which can affect crops.</p13>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p14>In addition to eroding shorelines, causing coastal floods, increasing the flow of salt water into estuaries, and depleting nearby groundwater aquifers, rising sea levels also submerge low-lying wetlands and dry land.</p14>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p15>A loss of species may result in the extinction of some animal species, which might lead to food shortages, environmental issues, and even a decline in global happiness.</p15>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p16>Food shortages can be defined in a way that is quite self-explanatory. At the rate of world population growth, however, there simply wouldn't be enough food for everyone. It would ruin the ecosystem of our world and result in many fatalities.</p16>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p17>Air pollution, illnesses, harsh weather conditions, and a great many more factors all increase health risks. They can also result in innumerable human and animal fatalities, which might have a number of long-term implications including food shortages, poverty, the extinction of species, and a reduction in the quality of the air.</p17>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p18>Global warming contributes to poverty and displacement by destroying houses and worsening health conditions. Families are uprooted when homes are damaged by floods or other extreme weather. While living in poverty, these families deal with terrible health risks, bad weather, and food shortages.</p18>
