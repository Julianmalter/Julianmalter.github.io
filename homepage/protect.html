        <h1 class = mt-4>How we can protect our earth from Global Warming worsening.</h1>
        <p1>1. Saving energy at home</p1>
        <br>
        <p2>2. Walking, biking or taking public transportation.</p2>
        <br>
        <p3>3. Eating more vegetables.</p3>
        <br>
        <p4>4. Considering your travel.</p4>
        <br>
        <p5>5. Throwing away less food.</p5>
        <br>
        <p6>6. Reduce, resuse, repair & recycle.</p6>
        <br>
        <p7>7. Changing your home's source of energy.</p7>
        <br>
        <p8>8. Switching to an electric vehicle (although it may be costly).</p8>
        <br>
        <p9>9. Making your money count.</p9>
        <br>
        <p10>10. Speak up.</p10>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p11>Much of our electricity and heat are powered by coal, oil and gas. Using more energy means using more coal, oil and gas.</p11>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p12>The world's roadways are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning diesel or gasoline. Using more vehicles means using more diesel or gasoline.</p12>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p13>Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and less meat and dairy, can significantly lower your environmental impact. Producing more plant-based foods means fewer usage of greenhouse gases.</p13>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p14>Airplanes burn large amounts of fossil fuels, producing significant greenhouse gas emissions. So considering your travels allow for use of fewer greenhouse gases emitted from planes.</p14>
        <br>
        <p15>When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy that were used to grow, produce, package, and transport it. So throwing food away is wasting food and materials.</p15>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p16>Reduce,reuse,repair and recycling allows for us to make the most out of all of our materials and to not waste them.</p16>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p17>Ask your utility company if your home energy comes from oil, coal or gas. If possible, see if you can switch to renewable sources such as wind or solar. This will allow for tremendous amount of non-renewable to not be used.</p17>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p18>If you plan to buy a car, consider going electric, with more and cheaper models coming on the market. In many countries, electric cars help reduce air pollution and cause significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than gas or diesel-powered vehicles.</p18>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p19>Everything we spend money on affects the planet. You have the power to choose which goods and services you support. To reduce your environmental impact, choose products from companies who use resources responsibly and are committed to cutting their gas emissions and waste.</p19>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p20>Speak up and get others to join in taking action. It's one of the quickest and most effective ways to make a difference.</p20>
