            <h1 class="mt-4">What is Global Warming?</h1>
            <br>
            <p1 style="font-size:15px" id="home" class="mt-4">The term "global warming" refers to the gradual warming of the earth's surface that has occurred since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900) as a result of human activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which raises the concentration of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p1>
            <p2 style="font-size:15px" id="home">Wet regions get wetter and dry areas become dryer in a warm environment because a warm temperature produces an atmosphere that can absorb, store, and release more water.</p3>
            <p3 style="font-size:15px" id="home">There are many different causes of Global Warming such as:</p4>
           <br>
           <br>
          <p4 style="font-size:15px">1. Industrialization</p5>
          <br>
          <p5 style="font-size:15px">2. Urbanization</p6>
          <br>
          <p6 style="font-size:15px">3. Deforestation</p7>
          <br>
          <p7 style="font-size:15px">4. Sophisticated Human Activities</p8>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p8 style="font-size:15px" id="home">Industrialization is the process of shifting the economy of a nation or area from an emphasis on agriculture to a dependence on industry. As a result of human activities, greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere have dramatically grown. Using fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, has increased the quantity of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution began around 1750.</p5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p9 style="font-size:15px" id="home">Large populations are permanently consolidated in comparatively limited regions through the process of urbanization, which gives rise to cities. Because urban activities require relatively large amounts of energy, they play a significant role in the rising emissions of greenhouse gases. Many metropolitan regions' rapidly expanding populations make them particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change.</p6>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p10 style="font-size:15px" id="home">The deliberate clearance of wooded terrain is known as deforestation. A large portion of the carbon contained in forests is released back into the environment when they are chopped down as carbon dioxide (CO2).</p7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p11 style="font-size:15px" id="home">Everything that humans undertake that might affect the environment is considered to be a sophisticated human activity. As a result of these human activities, more greenhouse gases, such as CO2, nitrous oxide, methane, and others, are being released into the atmosphere.</p8>
